Feature 22/01/25 - Java Findamentals. --> This feature typically covers the basics of Java programming, including syntax, variables, data types, and basic operations like arithmetic and logical operators. It sets the foundation for understanding how Java programs are structured and executed.

Fearure 23/01/25 - Java Control Flows. --> This feature focuses on control structures in Java, such as if-else statements, switch-case statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and how they control the flow of execution within a program. Understanding control flows is crucial for writing efficient and structured code.

Feature 25/01/25 - Arrays. --> Arrays in Java are fundamental data structures that store multiple elements of the same type sequentially in memory. This feature covers topics like array declaration, initialization, accessing elements, manipulating arrays (sorting, searching), and multi-dimensional arrays.

Feature 28/01/25 - Method and Functions. --> Methods and functions in Java are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. This feature explores method declaration, parameters, return types, method overloading, recursion, and the importance of modular programming through methods.

Feature 29/01/25 - Strings Handling and Common built in functions and java date and time functions. --> Strings in Java are objects that represent sequences of characters. This feature covers string manipulation (concatenation, substring, length), common methods like charAt(), indexOf(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), and the StringBuilder class for efficient string operations.

Feature 30/01/25 - Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals. --> Handling dates and times in Java involves the java.time package introduced in Java 8. This feature includes topics like LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, formatting dates, parsing strings to dates, calculating durations, and working with time zones.

Feature 02/02/25 - Java Constructors , Instance vs Class Variable , Access MOdifiers Concepts --> Constructors in Java are special methods used to initialize objects. This feature includes topics like default constructors, parameterized constructors, constructor chaining, instance vs. class variables (static variables), and access modifiers (public, private, protected) that control access to classes, constructors, methods, and variables.

Feature 04/02/25 - This, static, final key words and instanceof operator --> The this keyword refers to the current object, static makes variables/methods shared across all instances, final prevents modification, and instanceof checks an object's type at runtime. These features enhance clarity, reusability, and security in Java.
